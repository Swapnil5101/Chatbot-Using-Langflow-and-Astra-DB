# Agentic AI RAG (chatbot) model
In this project, a chatbot is built using DataStax Langflow framework to answer user queries on "Autonomous Vehicles", leveraging Gemini 2.0 flash LLM, and Astra DB vector database with Nvidia embeddings. The lanflow workflow expects an input file to work as a knowledge base for the chatbot to perform question answering on relevant topics. Apart from the document provided, it can also fetch details from the web.

Another Q&A chatbot is built using a basic prompt flow. It's provided in JSON format (used document is also attached).
