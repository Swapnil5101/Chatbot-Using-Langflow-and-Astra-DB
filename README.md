# Agentic AI RAG (chatbot) model
In this project, a chatbot is built using DataStax Langflow framework, leveraging Gemini 2.0 flash LLM, and Astra DB vector database with Nvidia embeddings. The lanflow workflow expects an input file to work as a knowledge base for the chatbot to perform question answering on relevant topics. Apart from the document provided, it can also fetch details from the web.
